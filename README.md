### :woman_technologist: About Me :

👀 About me: I am an 18 year old that is dedicated and hardworking, and I love to learn about the evergrowing technological developments and the applications of technology in different fields of science. Growing up surrounded by technology, my curiousty for how electronical devices and their inner processes work has exponentially grown. Since, learning about computer science, I have had a fascination for every area of the subject. However, my current interests involve cyber security and ethical hacking. Additionally, after learning about psychology at college, I've been intruiged about the use of technology in the aid of developing solutions for psychological theories. <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30"> 

<br>

🌱 What I am doing: Currently, I am in my firsty year of studying computer science at the University of South Wales, and I am hoping to acheive a bachelor's degree or potentially a masters degree in computer science. Although it is only the first term, the curriculum has provided a range of skills (such as relational database creating and queries through SQL, and logical thinking through creating small c++ programs and reversing the effects of a cypher on plaintext). 

<br>

💞️ Skillset: Currently, I have some basic programming knowledge with some previous experience in website creation and experience in the visual basic programming language. As a part of my coursework in college, I have also designed a game using GameMaker2 and have some insight on the procedures in development life-cycles. I hope to broaden my skillset during my course at university, and learn how to become proficiet in c++, python, and java.

🌱 Hobbies: During my spare time, I partake in a diverse set of activities that help me relax while keeping my brain active. One of my current passions is teaching myself how to play the piano, and learning songs by either reading sheet music or by playing the melody by ear. I am always up for the challenge to play any music regardless of the difficulty (even if I know that I may not be proficient enough to perfect a piece) as I find enjoyment in practicing and honing my ability to play well. 
I also enjoy learning new languages! Currently I am learning German through Duolingo as it does assist me in reading sheet music, and it helps me work on memory and problem-solving skill through different exercises that Duolingo provides.
However, one of my favourite things to do is to spend time with my family whether it's trying new experiences, exploring new places together, or even just having a fun conversation while shopping or watching a film.
